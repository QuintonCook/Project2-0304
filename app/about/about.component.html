        <p>
          In 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer genius's QMDD (The squad) begin work on a new concept that eventually turns into the global social network known as better Facebook. Six years later, they are one of the youngest billionaires ever, but the squad find that their unprecedented success leads to both personal and legal complications when they end up on the receiving end of two lawsuits, one involving their former friend (Andrew Garfield). Based on the book "The Accidental Billionaires."
